## Objective

The primary objective was to familiarize myself with essential Linux commands for navigating the file system, managing files and directories, and understanding basic file properties.

## Environment

All commands were executed within a remote Linux terminal provided by the TryHackMe platform.

## Screenshot

Here's a screenshot of the terminal session demonstrating the commands and their outputs:

## Commands and Outputs

Below is a detailed breakdown of each command executed, its output, and a brief explanation of its function.

### 1. `ls` - List Directory Contents

Lists files and directories within the current working directory.

```bash
tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls
access.log  folder1  folder2  folder3  folder4  newfolder  testfolder
planation: Shows all visible files and subdirectories present in the current location.

2. whoami - Display Current Username
Identifies the current user logged into the system.

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~$ whoami
tryhackme
Explanation: Confirms that the active user is tryhackme.

3. pwd - Print Working Directory
Displays the full path of the current working directory.

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~$ pwd
/home/tryhackme
Explanation: Indicates that the current directory is /home/tryhackme.

4. ls -l - Long Listing Format
Provides a detailed list of files and directories, including permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and last modification date/time.

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~$ ls -l
total 88
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tryhackme tryhackme  65522 May 10  2021 access.log
drwxr-xr-x 2 tryhackme tryhackme   4096 May 10  2021 folder1
drwxr-xr-x 2 tryhackme tryhackme   4096 May 10  2021 folder2
drwxr-xr-x 2 tryhackme tryhackme   4096 May 10  2021 folder3
drwxr-xr-x 2 tryhackme tryhackme   4096 May 10  2021 folder4
drwxrwxr-x 2 tryhackme tryhackme   4096 Jul 23 20:24 newfolder
drwxrwxr-x 2 tryhackme tryhackme   4096 Jul 23 20:31 testfolder
Explanation:

-rw-rw-r--: File permissions (owner read/write, group read/write, others read). A d at the start indicates a directory.

1: Number of hard links.

tryhackme tryhackme: Owner username and group name.

65522 / 4096: Size in bytes.

May 10 2021 / Jul 23 20:xx: Last modification date and time.

5. cd - Change Directory
Used to navigate into a specified directory.

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~$ cd folder4
tryhackme@linux1:~/folder4$ ls
note.txt
Explanation:

cd folder4: Changes the current working directory to folder4.

ls: Lists the contents of folder4, showing note.txt.

6. cat - Concatenate and Display File Content
Displays the content of a file. (Note: Attempting to cat a directory will result in an error).

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~/folder4$ cat folder4
cat: folder4: Is a directory
Explanation: The command failed because cat is used for files, and folder4 is a directory. The intention might have been to cat note.txt.

7. touch - Create Empty Files
Creates a new, empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~/folder4$ touch test_test.txt
Explanation: Creates an empty file named test_test.txt within the folder4 directory.

8. mkdir - Make Directories
Used to create new directories.

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~/folder4$ mkdir new_test
Explanation: Creates a new directory named new_test inside folder4.

9. rm - Remove Files or Directories
Deletes files or directories. Use with caution!

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~/folder4$ rm test.txt
Explanation: Removes the file test.txt from the folder4 directory. (This assumes test.txt existed or was created prior to test_test.txt).

10. ls -a - List All Files (Including Hidden)
Displays all files and directories, including those that start with a dot (.), which are hidden by default.

Bash

tryhackme@linux1:~/folder4$ ls -a
.  ..  .cache  .Xauthority  access.log  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .profile  folder1  folder2  folder3  folder4  newfolder  testfolder
Explanation:

.: Represents the current directory.

..: Represents the parent directory.

Other dot files (.cache, .bash_history, etc.) are system or user-specific configuration files that are typically hidden.
